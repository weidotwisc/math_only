This game is to play with a deck of cards. Each card is between 1 and 10. Each time, we draw 4 cards, and then we can use "add" and "sub" betwee them to calculate a target number t. Whoever first comes up with how to make the 4 cards t wins (if there is no way to get to t, we re-draw the 4 cards). The quesiton for the adult: what this magic number t is to avoid redrawing too much.
